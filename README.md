# CRUD-operations program

The following program allows users to store products, giving required information about them such as their name, price and quantity. 
In order to run it the user should be connected to an phpMyAdmin server through EXAMPP application where he can upload the products.sql database which consists of users's desired products.
The main purpose is to use the buttons in the frame once you run the app and then choose whether to add, update, delete or search for goods by their ID. There is also a 'Show All' button which displays the uploaded information by the user into a table for easier understanding and usage.
